This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in TypeScript. The `greeter` function expects a string argument, but an array is passed. This causes a compile-time error if TypeScript's type checking is enabled, which is essential for preventing runtime errors. The solution shows how to modify the code to properly handle the array of strings or change the function signature to handle arrays of strings.
